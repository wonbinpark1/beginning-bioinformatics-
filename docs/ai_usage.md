- Tool/model & version: ChatGPT
- What I asked for: How can I make a loop pick the highest value in parsed format by SEQIO 
- Snippet of prompt(s): By using loop, and if commend, make current GC takes the place of the maximum GC. 
- What I changed before committing: Before) Trying to put the value in the list and take the biggest value out -> after) set the intial value of maximum GC contents, and Seq.ID, so that the code can replace them to the new record every time it run iteration. 
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): ran the sample data(Rosalind Practice problem), to see if the code works.
